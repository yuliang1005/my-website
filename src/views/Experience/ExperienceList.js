During the upload process, the image is stored within an AWS S3 storage bucket. This allows users to search for content within the images and locate the respective images. For the user interface development, I exclusively employed React and integrated it seamlessly with AWS-based APIs to fulfill the client's specifications. The final web page deployment was accomplished using AWS Amplify.

At the same time, I also actively helped other developers in the project, and finally passed the acceptance of the customer. </>)
